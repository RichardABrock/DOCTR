TIMSS is run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) an international group of national research institutions and governments working to research and improve education. TIMSS launched in 2015\nThe study surveys both 9-10-year-old and 13-14-year-old students, across 64 countries (in 2019). Contextual data about schools, teachers and parents is collected in the survey. TIMSS advanced (running since 1995) collects data on students in their final year of secondary schooling.\nYou can read more about TIMSS, and download data sets, from the TIMSS website: TIMSS\n\n\n2 What is PIRLS?\nPIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) is the IEA’S parallel study to TIMSS which focuses on international literacy. The study samples 9-10-year old students and has taken place every five years since 2001.\nYou can read more about PIRLS, and download data sets, from the PIRLS website: TIMSS\n\n\n3 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS)\nICILS is the IEA international comparative assessment of students’ computing and IT literacy. First conducted in 2013, the study assesses computer and information literacy (CIL) and computational thinking (CT) of 13-14-year-old students. The assessment takes place every 5 years.\nLearn more about ICILS, and download data sets, from the ICILS website: ICILS"

    "text": "4.1 What are Plausible Values?\nIn the PISA dataset, the outcomes of student tests are reported as plausible values, for example, in the variables of the science test (PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV3SCIE, and PV5SCIE). It might seem counter intuitive that there are five values for a score on a test.\nPlausible values (PVs) are a way of expressing the error in a measurement. The number of questions in the full PISA survey is very large, so students are randomly allocated to take a subset of questions (and even then, the test still takes two hours!). As no student completes the full set of questions (only 40% of students even answer questions in reading, science and mathematics OECD (2014)), estimating how a student would have performed on the full question set involves some error. Plausible values are a way of expressing the uncertainty in the estimation of student scores.\nOne way of thinking of the PV scores is that they represent five different estimates of students’ abilities based on the questions they have answered. To decrease measurement error, five different approaches are applied to create five different estimates, the PV scores.\nThe PISA Data Analysis Manual suggests:\n\nPopulation statistics should be estimated using each plausible value separately. The reported population statistic is then the average of each plausible value statistic. For instance, if one is interested in the correlation coefficient between the social index and the reading performance in PISA, then five correlation coefficients should be computed and then averaged\nPlausible values should never be averaged at the student level, i.e. by computing in the dataset the mean of the five plausible values at the student level and then computing the statistic of interest once using that average PV value. Doing so would be equivalent to an EAP estimate, with a bias as described in the previous section.\n(Monseur et al. 2009, 100)"

    "text": "Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is an approach to representing the correlations between a number of variables linked to some phenomenon (Lomax 2013). A dependent variable (for example, scores on some test) might be linked to a number of independent variables (for example, hours of study, teacher’s level of experience, etc.). A powerful aspect of SEM is that it can be used to construct latent variables - variables which have explanatory usefulness but can’t be measured directly - out of a number of independent variables.\nFor example, a researcher might wish to investigate how home environment impacts students’ mathematics achievement. There is no single variable, no single score, that can be measured to represent a young person’s home environment as 7/10 or 3/10. We might then consider their home environment a latent variable. We imagine that the nature of the circumstances in their home impacts their learning, but we cannot directly report the level of the home environment as a variable.\nSEM allows us to propose a latent variable, like home environment, and calculate the contribution of a number of variables w can measure (e.g. the number of books in the home, parents’ occupation and level of education, family wealth, etc.) to the latent variable.\n\n\nResearchers use SEM to determine the correlations between a number of variable in a data set. It allows the relationship between multiple variables to be taken into account.\nFor example, in the PISA data set, in the context of data related to UK students achievement in mathematics, a researcher might be interested in building a model of mathematics (PV1MATH) score by a number of variables in the data set, for example, reading score (PV1READ), science score (PV1SCIE), family cultural capital (the index of economic, social and cultural status: ESCS), wealth (WEALTH) and gender (ST004D01T). SEM can be used to represent the relationship between these variables and students’ mathematics achievement.\nTo create the SEM we will use the lavaan package - lavaan is a contraction of Latent Variable Analysis and allows us to fit a number of different SEMs to data. We will also use the semPlot package to visualise the results. The relationships between variables in SEMs are often represented as path diagrams - representations in which variables are represented as squares or circles and arrows labelled with correlation coefficients join the variables to represent the relationships.semPlot allows use to draw path diagrams.\n\n\n\nTo create the SEM of UK mathematics achievement we first create a subset data.frame of UK data, UKdata. As lavaan uses numeric variables we need to convert gender (ST004D01T) to a numeric variable from its original form of a character variable (Male,Female,NA).\n\n# Load lavaan to create the SEM and semPlot to draw path diagrams\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(semPlot)\n# Create a subset of PISA data related to the UK containing the dependent variable of interest (PV1MATH) and the independent variables we are interested in\n1UKdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH, PV1READ, ESCS, HOMEPOS, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# lavaan requires numeric variables as input, gender is a character variable in the data.frame so convert it.\n\n4UKdata$ST004D01T&lt;-as.numeric(UKdata$ST004D01T)\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2022 dataset and pipes it into the next line using %&gt;%\n\n2\n\nline 2 selects the variables of interest\n\n3\n\nline 3 filters for the UK\n\n4\n\nline 4 convert gender variables from character to numeric\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to create the model. Models in lavaan are represented as a dependent variable y, linked to a number of independent variables x1, x2, x3, etc. The ~ symbol is the regression operator. A simple regression formula might then take the form of:\ny ~ x1 + x2 + x3\nTo indicate a variable is a latent variable we use the =~ operator. So to define a model in which the latent variable f1 varies with three independent variables we would write:\nf1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3\nIn some cases, the independent variables may correlate. For example, if we are investigating mathematics achievement (the dependent variable, y), by looking at the independent variables of reading (x1) and science score (x2), it may be the case that reading and science cores covary (that is changes to one impacts the other). In this case, we can specify covariance in our model by stating:\ny ~ x1 + x2 The regression model x1 ~ x2 Indicating the covariance\nIn our case, considering UK mathematics achievement, we can set up a model that mathematics score PV1MATH varies with science score PV1SCIE, reading score PV1READ, cultural resources in the home ESCS, a wealth proxy measure, HOMEPOS and gender ST004D01T: model &lt;- \"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nWe then pass the model, and the data.frame to the sem function: fit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata). This produces a model as the output fit. To see the results we call summary(fit)\n\n1model&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\n\n2fit&lt;-sem(model, data = UKdata)\n\n3summary(fit)\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 specify the model - we want to model PV1MATH using PV1SCIE, PV1READ, ESCS (class proxy) and HOMEPOS (wealth proxy).\n\n2\n\nline 2 create the model using the fit function\n\n3\n\nline 3 print the model\n\n\n\n\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate   Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                            \n    PV1SCIE            0.565    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ            0.267    0.006   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS               5.432    0.734    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS            1.027    0.716    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate   Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH         2006.033   26.948   74.441    0.000\n\n\nIn the regressions table, the function returns the value of the regression coefficients for each independent variable, and the P value (P(&gt;|z|)). Note in the model above all the independent variables are significant, but the largest loading comes from the WEALTH variable, with the science (PV1SCIE) and reading (PV1READ) scores contributing comparatively little.\nFinally, to produce a visual representation of the model, we pass our model, fit to the semPaths function (from the semPlot package we loaded above). We can specify was we want displayed on the lines, in this case the estimate of the regression coefficients between the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn path diagrams, directly measured variables, manifest variables, are shown as squares. Latent variables are represented as circles. Single headed arrows represent the regression effects between variables. The curved arrows starting and ending on a square or circle indicate the variances of those variables. When curved arrows start and end on different variables, they represent covariance.\nOne issue to note here is the difference in the variance for the science and mathematics scores. PV1SCIE, PV1READ and PV1MATH are test scores and so have a large variance (the maximum and minimum science scores, for example, are 0.0 and 895.4). The variance of the two test variables is much greater that for HOMEPOS (Min=-10.0741 mean=-0.4447, Max=15.240) and ESCS (Min=-6.841 mean=-0.310, Max=7.380).\nTo resolve this difference, we can use the scale function to create a similar scale for PV1SCIE, PV1MATH and PV1READ. The scale function sets the mean of the variable to 0 and the variance to 1.\n\n1UKdata$PV1READ&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1READ)\n2UKdata$PV1MATH&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1MATH)\n3UKdata$PV1SCIE&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1SCIE)\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 normalise the reading scores about a mean of 0 with a variance of 1\n\n2\n\nline 2 normalise maths scores\n\n3\n\nline 3 normalise science scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.607    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ           0.295    0.007   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS              0.057    0.008    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS           0.011    0.008    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.222    0.003   74.441    0.000\n\n\nScaling the test scores gives a more balanced model.\nWe can make the model more complex, by adding that two of our independent variables, reading (PV1READ) and science (PV1SCIE) scores may co-vary, and vary with other independent variables.

For example, we might assume that students have some underlying variable linked to their general intelligence. However, in the PISA data set, we have no variable that directly measures students general intelligence. We do have data on their achievement in science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) and we might assume that as the latent variable of general achievement increases so does achievement in science, mathematics and reading.\nTo perform the analysis, we use the =~ operator in our model, which indicates a latent variable. This time, our model then sets out that we are interested in a lv (latent variable) which varies with science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) scores:\nmodel&lt;-“lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH”\nThen we run the model using sem in the same way as above, and plot the model using semPaths.\n\n# For a latent variable\n# =~ means a latent variable\n\nmodel&lt;-\"lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH\"\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data = UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 18 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         6\n\n  Number of observations                         12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nLatent Variables:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  lv =~                                               \n    PV1SCIE           1.000                           \n    PV1READ           0.919    0.006  143.596    0.000\n    PV1MATH           1.015    0.006  175.355    0.000\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1SCIE           0.145    0.003   43.323    0.000\n   .PV1READ           0.278    0.004   66.360    0.000\n   .PV1MATH           0.119    0.003   36.723    0.000\n    lv                0.855    0.013   67.872    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\nThe mode raises the question of how strong does correlation between independent variables and a proposed latent variable need to be.

(2020) suggest that:\n\n“When N = 100, researchers may choose a GFI [Meaning Goodness-of-Fit Index] cutoff value of .89 …When N &gt; 100, researchers may choose a GFI cutoff value of .93” (Cho et al. 2020, 197)\n\nWe can develop a more complex latent variable model. Let us assume that UK students reading scores depend on two latent variables, home environment (lvh, e.g. number of books, parental level of education etc.) and cognitive ability (lvc, e.g. as reported by science and mathematics scores).

The same is true for PV1MATH for the ability latent variable.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of formatting options in the semPaths function.\nStarting from this plot:\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\") \n\n\n\n\n\nTo rotate the plot (rotation=2):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation=2) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the colour of the lines (edge.color=\"blue\") and the size of the nodes (sizeMan=8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", sizeMan = 8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo link the thickness of lines to their value (\"std\"):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\") \n\n\n\n\n\nTo make the labels larger (edge.label.cex = 0.8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the text size in the nodes (label.cex = 0.8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8,\n         label.cex = 0.8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo add a title (title(\"PISA path diagram\")):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", sizeMan = 5, \"std\", \n         edge.label.cex = 0.8) \ntitle(\"PISA path diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give longer node names (nodeNames=nodenames), and you can increase the abbreviation of labels to a set number of characters in the nodes using nCharNodes = 3:\n\n\nnodenames&lt;-c(\"Economic, social and cultural status\",\n             \"Wealth\",\"Maternal Schooling\",\"Paternal Schooling\",\n             \"In home: classical literature\",\"Books in home\",\n             \"Math score\", \"Reading score\", \"Science Score\")\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation=2, edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan =5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8, nodeNames = nodenames,\n         nCharNodes = 5)\ntitle(\"PISA path diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on formatting path diagrams using semPaths on semptools and on the Comprehensive R Archive network (CRAN) documentation for the package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a SEM of reading scores in the PISA data for students in the United States.

    "text": "To create the SEM of UK mathematics achievement we first create a subset data.frame of UK data, UKdata. As lavaan uses numeric variables we need to convert gender (ST004D01T) to a numeric variable from its original form of a character variable (Male,Female,NA).\n\n# Load lavaan to create the SEM and semPlot to draw path diagrams\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(semPlot)\n# Create a subset of PISA data related to the UK containing the dependent variable of interest (PV1MATH) and the independent variables we are interested in\n1UKdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH, PV1READ, ESCS, HOMEPOS, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# lavaan requires numeric variables as input, gender is a character variable in the data.frame so convert it.\n\n4UKdata$ST004D01T&lt;-as.numeric(UKdata$ST004D01T)\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2022 dataset and pipes it into the next line using %&gt;%\n\n2\n\nline 2 selects the variables of interest\n\n3\n\nline 3 filters for the UK\n\n4\n\nline 4 convert gender variables from character to numeric\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to create the model. Models in lavaan are represented as a dependent variable y, linked to a number of independent variables x1, x2, x3, etc. The ~ symbol is the regression operator. A simple regression formula might then take the form of:\ny ~ x1 + x2 + x3\nTo indicate a variable is a latent variable we use the =~ operator. So to define a model in which the latent variable f1 varies with three independent variables we would write:\nf1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3\nIn some cases, the independent variables may correlate. For example, if we are investigating mathematics achievement (the dependent variable, y), by looking at the independent variables of reading (x1) and science score (x2), it may be the case that reading and science cores covary (that is changes to one impacts the other). In this case, we can specify covariance in our model by stating:\ny ~ x1 + x2 The regression model x1 ~ x2 Indicating the covariance\nIn our case, considering UK mathematics achievement, we can set up a model that mathematics score PV1MATH varies with science score PV1SCIE, reading score PV1READ, cultural resources in the home ESCS, a wealth proxy measure, HOMEPOS and gender ST004D01T: model &lt;- \"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nWe then pass the model, and the data.frame to the sem function: fit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata). This produces a model as the output fit.

Note in the model above all the independent variables are significant, but the largest loading comes from the WEALTH variable, with the science (PV1SCIE) and reading (PV1READ) scores contributing comparatively little.\nFinally, to produce a visual representation of the model, we pass our model, fit to the semPaths function (from the semPlot package we loaded above). We can specify was we want displayed on the lines, in this case the estimate of the regression coefficients between the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn path diagrams, directly measured variables, manifest variables, are shown as squares. Latent variables are represented as circles. Single headed arrows represent the regression effects between variables. The curved arrows starting and ending on a square or circle indicate the variances of those variables. When curved arrows start and end on different variables, they represent covariance.\nOne issue to note here is the difference in the variance for the science and mathematics scores. PV1SCIE, PV1READ and PV1MATH are test scores and so have a large variance (the maximum and minimum science scores, for example, are 0.0 and 895.4). The variance of the two test variables is much greater that for HOMEPOS (Min=-10.0741 mean=-0.4447, Max=15.240) and ESCS (Min=-6.841 mean=-0.310, Max=7.380).\nTo resolve this difference, we can use the scale function to create a similar scale for PV1SCIE, PV1MATH and PV1READ. The scale function sets the mean of the variable to 0 and the variance to 1.\n\n1UKdata$PV1READ&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1READ)\n2UKdata$PV1MATH&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1MATH)\n3UKdata$PV1SCIE&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1SCIE)\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 normalise the reading scores about a mean of 0 with a variance of 1\n\n2\n\nline 2 normalise maths scores\n\n3\n\nline 3 normalise science scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.607    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ           0.295    0.007   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS              0.057    0.008    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS           0.011    0.008    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.222    0.003   74.441    0.000\n\n\nScaling the test scores gives a more balanced model.\nWe can make the model more complex, by adding that two of our independent variables, reading (PV1READ) and science (PV1SCIE) scores may co-vary, and vary with other independent variables.

For example, we might assume that students have some underlying variable linked to their general intelligence. However, in the PISA data set, we have no variable that directly measures students general intelligence. We do have data on their achievement in science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) and we might assume that as the latent variable of general achievement increases so does achievement in science, mathematics and reading.\nTo perform the analysis, we use the =~ operator in our model, which indicates a latent variable. This time, our model then sets out that we are interested in a lv (latent variable) which varies with science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) scores:\nmodel&lt;-“lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH”\nThen we run the model using sem in the same way as above, and plot the model using semPaths.\n\n# For a latent variable\n# =~ means a latent variable\n\nmodel&lt;-\"lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH\"\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data = UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 18 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         6\n\n  Number of observations                         12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nLatent Variables:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  lv =~                                               \n    PV1SCIE           1.000                           \n    PV1READ           0.919    0.006  143.596    0.000\n    PV1MATH           1.015    0.006  175.355    0.000\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1SCIE           0.145    0.003   43.323    0.000\n   .PV1READ           0.278    0.004   66.360    0.000\n   .PV1MATH           0.119    0.003   36.723    0.000\n    lv                0.855    0.013   67.872    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\nThe mode raises the question of how strong does correlation between independent variables and a proposed latent variable need to be. Cho and colleagues Cho et al. (2020) suggest that:\n\n“When N = 100, researchers may choose a GFI [Meaning Goodness-of-Fit Index] cutoff value of .89 …When N &gt; 100, researchers may choose a GFI cutoff value of .93” (Cho et al. 2020, 197)\n\nWe can develop a more complex latent variable model. Let us assume that UK students reading scores depend on two latent variables, home environment (lvh, e.g. number of books, parental level of education etc.) and cognitive ability (lvc, e.g. as reported by science and mathematics scores).

The same is true for PV1MATH for the ability latent variable.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of formatting options in the semPaths function.\nStarting from this plot:\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\") \n\n\n\n\n\nTo rotate the plot (rotation=2):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation=2) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the colour of the lines (edge.color=\"blue\") and the size of the nodes (sizeMan=8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", sizeMan = 8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo link the thickness of lines to their value (\"std\"):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\") \n\n\n\n\n\nTo make the labels larger (edge.label.cex = 0.8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the text size in the nodes (label.cex = 0.8):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan = 5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8,\n         label.cex = 0.8) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo add a title (title(\"PISA path diagram\")):\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation = 2, \n         edge.color = \"blue\", sizeMan = 5, \"std\", \n         edge.label.cex = 0.8) \ntitle(\"PISA path diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give longer node names (nodeNames=nodenames), and you can increase the abbreviation of labels to a set number of characters in the nodes using nCharNodes = 3:\n\n\nnodenames&lt;-c(\"Economic, social and cultural status\",\n             \"Wealth\",\"Maternal Schooling\",\"Paternal Schooling\",\n             \"In home: classical literature\",\"Books in home\",\n             \"Math score\", \"Reading score\", \"Science Score\")\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\", rotation=2, edge.color = \"blue\", \n         sizeMan =5, \"std\", edge.label.cex = 0.8, nodeNames = nodenames,\n         nCharNodes = 5)\ntitle(\"PISA path diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find more information on formatting path diagrams using semPaths on semptools and on the Comprehensive R Archive network (CRAN) documentation for the package."

    "text": "The tidyverse includes the incredibly powerful ggplot2 package. This package is pretty much the industry standard for making graphs for publication. ggplot2 is built on the grammar of graphics where you build graphs by specifying underlying attributes and layering geometric objects on top of each other. In the diagram below you can see how a graph is built from geometric objects (the things that are plotted such as points and bars) a scale, and plot annotations (e.g. a key, title etc). You can then apply faceting to the graph to automatically split one graph into multiple plots, allowing you to easily compare different groupings. Publications, such as the Financial Times, make daily use of ggplot2."

The below example shows how we can specify within the ggplot function data=country_plot_data. We then define the aesthetic attributes of the graph, passing the x x=NumberOfBoys and y y=NumberOfGirls values. Once these have been declared in the ggplot(...) function, their values are passed down to any subsequent geom_, in this case geom_point will use the data and x and y values that have been specified in ggplot(...)\n\n# create a new dataframe of maths and reading scores by country and OECD status\n1country_plot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n3  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH),\n            mean_read = mean(PV1READ),\n            sz = n())\n\n# using this new dataframe, show the relationship between maths and reading score\n# using geom_points\n4ggplot(data=country_plot_data,\n5       aes(x=mean_maths, y=mean_read)) +\n6  geom_point(aes(size=sz, colour=OECD), alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n1\n\npipe the large data.frame PISA_2022 to apply a number of functions.\n\n2\n\ngroups by OECD (a Yes or No indicating membership) and CNT (the name of the country).\n\n3\n\ncalculate the mean mathematics and reading score, and create new variables (mean_maths, and mean_read) for their values.

To compare different groups we need the bars to not be stacked, we want them next to each other, or in ggplot language, we want the bars to dodge each other, to do this we add the position=position_dodge() command to line 3 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Raising the bars yourself\nggplot can do a lot of the hard work when putting together bar charts, e.g. counting the number of students in each group, but there might also be times when you want to use pipes to calculate summary values that you then want plot. That is, you want to specify the heights of the bars yourself. To do this we will specify the y axis in the aes and use stat=\"indentity\" to tell ggplot that’s what we’re doing.

    "text": "6.1 Task 1 - Binning data\nFrequency plots are often used to show data following a normal distribution, To produce a frequency plot, we need to divide data into counts, each covering a range of data. This is called ‘binning’. There is a choice to be made here, in how large or small to make the divisions (‘bins’) - this can affect how the data looks when graphed.\nFor example, to produce a frequency plot of science scores in the UK, we can first run a summary command on PV1SCIE to find the minimum and maximum score:\n\n# Find the range of science score\nsummary(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n    0.0   371.7   444.5   450.5   524.7   895.4 \n\n\nIf we wanted to plot a frequency chart of heights, we might divide the range of scores (from 0-895.4) into bins of 20 points. To do this we can use the cut(&lt;field&gt;,&lt;breaks&gt;) function within the mutate command on a ‘data.frame’. The &lt;field&gt; specifies the range (i.e. from around 0-900) and &lt;breaks&gt; the size of bins.\nIn the example below, we use cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0,900,20)) to create a new vector (column in the table) with the science scores divided up into bins. The specification breaks=seq(0,900,20)) sets how the data are divided up - into bins (i.e. groups of respondents) of scores starting at 0 and rising to 900 in steps of 20.\n\n# Creates distribution of science scores\n\nbinnedsize &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% # Creates a new data frame with binned data\n  select(PV1SCIE, CNT)%&gt;% # Select the columns needed\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")%&gt;%\n  mutate(BinnedPV1SCIE = cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0, 900, 20)))%&gt;%\n  na.omit() # Drop any NAs\n\n# Plot the data as a bar graph\nggplot(binnedsize,\n       aes(x = BinnedPV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"dark green\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(y = \"Number of responses\", x = \"Scores range\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a graph of the binned counts of mathematics scores in Malta.

    "section": "6.2 Task 2 - Plotting data on maps",
    "text": "6.2 Task 2 - Plotting data on maps\nAs well as graphs, R can also plot data onto maps. The geom_map function will plot a map of a region and you can either plot points (using geom_point) or fill regions by drawing a polygon of the shape of that region (using geom_polygon).\nFor example, imagine we created a data frame of the mean science scores of countries in the PISA data:\n\n# Pipe the total data frame and calculate the mean science scores\n# To match with another data frame we will use, we will rename CNT to region\nWorldSci &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanSci = mean(PV1SCIE)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n\nIn order to plot the data onto a map, colouring the countries by science scores, we need data which gives the coordinates of the edges of the countries. This data is available from the map_data function in ggplot. First we load the latitude and longitude data into a new data frame world_data. In the next steps we will then use left_join to combine it with the science data, but we need to tidy the data to match the PISA data, before we can join the two data sets.\n\n# Create a data frame of country latitude and longitude data\nworld_data &lt;- map_data(map = \"world\")\n\nOne quirk of the two data frames (world_data and the PISA data) is that some countries have different names. For example, PISA uses ‘United Kingdom’, but the rworldmap package uses ‘UK’. We can change the names of countries in the PISA data.frame to match those in rworldmap, using the case_when function with mutate. For example, if we want to change all United Kingdom entries to UK we use: mutate(region = case_when(region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\". The final part of the case_when sets the default - .default = region - that means if none of the matches are found, then region is set to region - i.e. it is left unchanged.\n\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States). Change the level names in the PISA data to match the world_data\n\n WorldSci &lt;- WorldSci %&gt;%\n   mutate(region = case_when(\n                       region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\",\n                       region == \"United States\"  ~ \"USA\",\n                       .default = region))\n\nNow that the country names in the two data frames match, we can use left_join to combine them.\n\n# Add the country latitude and longitude data to the PISA scores\n\nWorldSci &lt;- left_join(WorldSci, world_data, by = \"region\")\n\nTo add labels, you can create a data.frame, with only the country names, and their longitudes and latitudes (the mean of the country longitude and latitude), to use as the labels. You can then add geom_text_repelto add the labels. The repel means the labels won’t overlap. Given the number of countries, using geom_text_repel creates a warning that some labels won’t fit.\nTo plot the data, we use ggplot, with the data frame to WorldSci, and the x and y variables set to long and lat, the longitudes and latitudes. We specify that we want to keep the grouping of the data frame (i.e. by country).\nFirst we use geom_map to plot a blank map using the data - this will be the base for the highlighted countries. In the aes we give the longitudes and latitudes, and, as we want a blank map, set the fill to white and the line colour to black.\nFinally, we use geom_polygon to draw coloured shapes, with the fill changing by the value of meanSci. To make the map look nice, I have used a pre-defined colour scale.\n\n# Use geom_map to plot the basic world map (fill is white, line colour is black)\n# Use geom_polygon to plot the PISA data\n# Add a colour scale\nggplot(data = WorldSci, aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data, \n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\", \n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\")\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot, by default, the aesthetics are passed from one layer to the next. In our first aes call we set a grouping (group=group). However, when we come to the labeling function geom_text_repel, the data frame Labels is not grouped. We therefore need to use new aesthetics and want to ignore the original aesthetics (aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group,label=region))) we previously set.We do this with the command inherit.aes = FALSE (i.e. do not inherit the previous aesthetics).\nTo neaten up the labels we use the ggrepel package to get the geom_text_repel function. You’ll need to make sure that you have installed the ggrepel package, for a reminder on how to install packages see ?@sec-installation. This ensures that text labels don’t overlap. Then in geom_text_repel(data=Labels, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(x=long, y=lat,label=region)) we specify the label data.frame, and in aes pass the positions of the labels (x=long, y=lat) and specify that the labels are in the region vector.\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(data = WorldSci, \n       aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,label = region)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data,\n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\",\n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = Labels,\n                 inherit.aes = FALSE,\n                 aes(x = long, y = lat, label = region))\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot mean PISA mathematics scores on a world map, labelling the countries.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n# Create a data.frame of mathematics scores\nWorldMath &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanmath = mean(PV1MATH)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States).

    "text": "2.2 Types of Chi-Square Tests\nChi-square tests can be categorised in two groups:\n\nA test of goodness of fit - this is a form of hypothesis test which determines whether a sample fits a wider population. For example, does the pattern of exam results in one school fit the national distribution?\nA test of independence - allows inference to be made about whether two categorical variables in a population are related. For example, are there differences in the uptake of careers by gender?\n\nFor more information on chi-square tests, see chapter 12, in Navaro’s Learning Statistics with R."

Alternatively, we can visualise the data from the contingency table by building a mosaic plot, a form of stacked bar chart. Mosaic plots can be a useful visulations before running a chi-squared test.\nTo create a mosaic plot, you are going to need to install and load the ggmosaic package. See ?@sec-load-run-pckges for more details on how to do this.\nImagine we want to plot the ‘accomplishment’ data (WB178Q01HA) from the previous section for the Netherlands, Mexico and New Zealand.\nTo create the mosaic plot we use ggplot, as we used for previous graphs. As before, we first pass the data (in this case Accomp) to ggplot. Then, to create the graph, geom_mosaic is used. geom_mosaic does not have a direct mapping of input to x and y variable so we need to pass it what we want plotted on the y-axis (WB178Q01HA) and x-axis (CNT) within the product function (product(WB178Q01HA, CNT)). We can also specify how we want the rectangles to be coloured (in our case, by CNT).\n\n # install.packages(\"ggmosaic\")\nlibrary(ggmosaic)\n\n# Create a data frame of accomplishment data for the 3 countries\nAccomp&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(WB178Q01HA, CNT) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Netherlands\" | CNT == \"Mexico\"| CNT == \"New Zealand\") %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\n# plot results\n# Note that with geom_mosaic you pass the x and y variables using: aes(x = product(WB178Q01HA, CNT))\n\n5ggplot(data = Accomp) +\n6  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(WB178Q01HA, CNT), fill = CNT)) +\n7  xlab(\"Country\") +\n8  ylab(\"Did you accomplish something yesterday?\")\n\n\n5\n\nline 5 - set the data to be plotted (data = Accomp)\n\n6\n\nline 6 - in geom_mosaic the x and y variables are set using x= product (x, y). Here we set x = product(WB178Q01HA, CNT) and set the fill by country (fill = CNT)\n\n7\n\nline 7 - set the x-axis label\n\n8\n\nline 8 - set the y-axis label\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in the mosaic plot the width of the bars represents the number of students in the sample for each country."

This is data for all the students from around the world that took part in PISA 2022. The actual PISA dataset has many more columns than this, but for the examples here we have selected 83 of the more interesting data variables. The column names might seem rather confusing and you might want to refer to the PISA 2022 code book to find out what everything means.\nThe data shown in the console window is only the top few rows and first few columns. To see the whole table click on the Environment panel and the table icon  to explore the table:\n\nAlternatively, you can also hold down command ⌘|control and click on the table name in your R Script to view the table. You can also type View(&lt;table_name&gt;). Note: this has a capital “V”\nIn the table view mode you can read the label attached to each column, this will give you more detail about what the column stores. If you hover over columns it will display the label:\n\nAlternatively, to read the full label of a column, the following code can be used:\n\n# You might also want to read the label of a field\nattr(PISA_2022$ST324Q11JA, \"label\")\n\n[1] \"Agree/disagree: School has been a waste of time.\"\n\n\nEach view only shows you 50 columns, to see more use the navigation panel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo learn more about loading data from in other formats, e.g. SPSS and STATA, look at the tidyverse documentation for haven.\n\n\nThe PISA_2022 dataframe is made up of multiple columns, with each column acting like a vector, which means each column stores values of only one datatype. If we look at the first four columns of the schools table, you can see the CNTSTUID, ESCS and PV1MATH columns are &lt;dbl&gt; (numeric) and the other three columns are of &lt;fctr&gt; (factor), a special datatype in R that helps store categorical and ordinal variables, see Section 9.2 for more information on how factors work.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  CNTSTUID ST004D01T CNT       ESCS PV1MATH\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   800001 Female    Albania  1.11     180.\n2   800002 Male      Albania -3.05     308.\n3   800003 Male      Albania -0.187    268.\n4   800005 Female    Albania -3.22     273.\n5   800006 Female    Albania -1.05     435.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVectors are data structures that bring together one or more data elements of the same datatype. E.g. we might have a numeric vector recording the grades of a class, or a character vector storing the gender of a set of students. To define a vector we use c(item, item, ...), where c stands for combine. Vectors are very important to R, even declaring a single object, x &lt;- 6, is creating a vector of size one. To find out more about vectors see: ?@sec-vectors\n\n\nWe can find out some general information about the table we have loaded. nrow and ncol tell you about the dimensions of the table\n\nnrow(PISA_2022)  # how many rows are in the results table\n\n[1] 613744\n\nncol(PISA_2022)  # how many columns are in the results table\n\n[1] 83\n\n\nIf we want to know the names of the columns we can use the names() command that returns a vector. This can be a little confusing as it’ll return the names used in the dataframe, which can be hard to interpret, e.g. ST004D01T is PISA’s way of encoding gender. You might find the labels in the view of the table available through View(PISA_2022) (note: the capital V in View) and the Environment panel easier to navigate:\n\nnames(PISA_2022) # the column names of a table\n\n [1] \"CNT\"          \"CNTSCHID\"     \"CNTSTUID\"     \"REGION\"       \"OECD\"        \n [6] \"LANGTEST_QQQ\" \"ST003D02T\"    \"ST003D03T\"    \"ST004D01T\"    \"ST250Q01JA\"  \n[11] \"ST250Q02JA\"   \"ST250Q03JA\"   \"ST250Q05JA\"   \"ST251Q01JA\"   \"ST251Q06JA\"  \n[16] \"ST251Q07JA\"   \"ST253Q01JA\"   \"ST254Q01JA\"   \"ST254Q02JA\"   \"ST254Q03JA\"  \n[21] \"ST254Q04JA\"   \"ST254Q05JA\"   \"ST254Q06JA\"   \"ST255Q01JA\"   \"ST256Q02JA\"  \n[26] \"ST005Q01JA\"   \"ST007Q01JA\"   \"ST019AQ01T\"   \"ST019BQ01T\"   \"ST019CQ01T\"  \n[31] \"ST125Q01NA\"   \"ST261Q01JA\"   \"ST261Q04JA\"   \"ST062Q02TA\"   \"ST038Q08NA\"  \n[36] \"ST016Q01NA\"   \"ST337Q07JA\"   \"ST324Q11JA\"   \"ST355Q03JA\"   \"FL150Q02TA\"  \n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 43 entries ]\n\n\nAs mentioned, the columns in the tables are very much like a collection of vectors, to access these columns we can put a $ [dollar sign] after the name of a table.

You can work out the mode of data by using the modeest package:\n\nlibrary(modeest)\nmlv(PISA_2022$PV1MATH, method = \"mfv\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 386.086\n\n\nThere is more discussion on how to use modes in R here\n\n\nCalculations might also be upset when you try to perform maths on a column that you think is a number but is actually stored as another datatype. For example if you wanted to work out the mean number of “How many [digital devices] with screens are there in your [home]?” - ST253Q01JA:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$ST253Q01JA, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nLooking at the structure of this column, we can see it is stored as a factor, not as a numeric. Factors are a special datatype that use numbers to link to categorical values. For ST253Q01JA there are 12 different levels that you can explore using the str() and levels() commands:\n\nstr(PISA_2022$ST253Q01JA)\n\n Factor w/ 12 levels \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\",..: 8 2 8 2 7 8 7 NA 6 7 ...\n - attr(*, \"label\")= chr \"How many [digital devices] with screens are there in your [home]?\"\n\nlevels(PISA_2022$ST253Q01JA)\n\n [1] \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\"\n [2] \"One\"                                         \n [3] \"Two\"                                         \n [4] \"Three\"                                       \n [5] \"Four\"                                        \n [6] \"Five\"                                        \n [7] \"6 to 10\"                                     \n [8] \"More than 10\"                                \n [9] \"Valid Skip\"                                  \n[10] \"Not Applicable\"                              \n[11] \"Invalid\"                                     \n[12] \"No Response\"                                 \n\n\nYou can change the type of the column to make it work with the mean command, changing the column to as.numeric(&lt;column&gt;) for the calculation:\n\n# note: this isn't ideal for proper analysis!\nmean(as.numeric(PISA_2022$ST253Q01JA), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 6.312233\n\n\nThis is far from ideal as we are now treating a categorical field as a numeric! Looking at the coding for the numbers in the field and the corresponding levels, we see that 1 is actually no digital devices.

There are several powerful commands in the tidyverse as part of the dplyr package that can help us group, filter, select, mutate and summarise datasets. With this small set of commands we can use piping to convert massive datasets into simple and useful results.\nUsing the pipe %&gt;% command, we can feed the results from one command into the next command making for reusable and easy to read code.\n\n\n\nhow piping works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe pipe command we are using %&gt;% is from the magrittr package which is installed alongside the tidyverse. Recently R introduced another pipe |&gt; which offers very similar functionality and tutorials online might use either. The examples below use the %&gt;% pipe.\n\n\nLet’s look at an example of using the pipe on the PISA_2022 table to calculate the best performing OECD countries for maths PV1MATH by gender ST004D01T:\n\n1PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  filter(OECD == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n3  group_by(CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n4  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_maths = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),       \n            students = n()) %&gt;%                       \n5  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T)) %&gt;%\n6  arrange(desc(mean_maths))\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2022 dataset and pipes it into the next line using %&gt;%\n\n2\n\nline 2 filters out any results that are from non-OECD countries by finding all the rows where OECD equals == “Yes”, this is then piped to the next line\n\n3\n\nline 3 groups the data by country CNT and by student gender ST004D01T, this is then piped to the next line\n\n4\n\nline 4-6 the summarise command performs a calculation on the country and gender groupings returning three new columns, each command is described by code on a new line and separated by a comma: the mean value for maths mean_maths, the standard deviation sd_maths, and a column telling us how many students were in each grouping using the n() which returns the number of rows in a group. These new columns and the grouping columns are then piped to the next line, all other columns are dropped\n\n5\n\nline 7 filters out any gender ST004D01T that is NA. First is finds all the students that have NA as their gender by using is.na(ST004D01T), then it NOTs/flips the result using the exclamation mark !, giving those students who don’t have their gender set to NA. The filtered data is then piped to the next line\n\n6\n\nline 8, finally we arrange/sort the results in descending order by the mean_maths column. The default for arrange is ascending order, leave out the desc(  ) for the numbers to be ordered in the opposite way.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 5\n# Groups:   CNT [37]\n   CNT            ST004D01T mean_maths sd_maths students\n   &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Japan          Male            540.     99.0     2856\n 2 Korea          Male            534.    112.      3325\n 3 Japan          Female          531.     88.1     2904\n 4 Korea          Female          528.     99.1     3129\n 5 Estonia        Male            515.     87.4     3272\n 6 Switzerland    Male            511.     99.3     3540\n 7 Estonia        Female          510.     81.5     3120\n 8 Czech Republic Male            502.    100.      4232\n 9 Switzerland    Female          501.     90.9     3289\n10 Austria        Male            500.     94.5     3110\n# ℹ 64 more rows\n\n\nAcross the top few countries, Males get a slightly better maths score PV1MATH than Females, other scores are available, please read ?@sec-PV to find out more about the limitations of using a “PV” value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nwe met the assignment command earlier &lt;-.

    "text": "9.1 Recoding data (ifelse)\nOften we want to plot values in groupings that don’t yet exist, for example might want to give all schools over a certain size a different colour from others schools, or flag up students who have a different home language to the language that is being taught in school. To do this we need to look at how we can recode values. A common way to recode values is through an ifelse statement:\n\nifelse(&lt;statement(s)&gt;, &lt;value_if_true&gt;, &lt;value_if_false&gt;)\n\nifelse allows us to recode the data. In the example below, we are going to add a new column to the PISA_2022 dataset (using mutate) noting whether a student got a higher grade in their Maths PV1MATH or Reading PV1READ tests. if PV1MATH is bigger then PV1READ, the maths_better is TRUE, else maths_better is FALSE, or in dplyr format:\n\nmaths_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(maths_better = \n           ifelse(PV1MATH &gt; PV1READ,\n                  TRUE, \n                  FALSE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T, maths_better, PV1MATH, PV1READ)\n\nprint(maths_data)\n\n# A tibble: 613,744 × 5\n   CNT     ST004D01T maths_better PV1MATH PV1READ\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania Female    FALSE           180.    248.\n 2 Albania Male      TRUE            308.    258.\n 3 Albania Male      FALSE           268.    285.\n 4 Albania Female    FALSE           273.    322.\n 5 Albania Female    FALSE           435.    464.\n 6 Albania Male      TRUE            534.    451.\n 7 Albania Male      FALSE           382.    391.\n 8 Albania Female    FALSE           273.    308.\n 9 Albania Female    FALSE           355.    429.\n10 Albania Female    TRUE            430.    420.\n# ℹ 613,734 more rows\n\n\nWe now take this new dataset maths_data and look at whether the difference between relative performance in maths and reading is the same for girls and boys:\n\nmaths_data %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T), !is.na(maths_better)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ST004D01T, maths_better) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n()) \n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n# Groups:   ST004D01T [2]\n  ST004D01T maths_better      n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female    FALSE        180350\n2 Female    TRUE         125409\n3 Male      FALSE        118341\n4 Male      TRUE         189565\n\n\n\nAdjust the code above to work out the percentages of Males and Females ST004D01T in each group.

Take this example. Let’s flag students who have a different home language LANGN to the language that is being used in the PISA assessment tool LANGTEST_QQQ.

    "section": "9.2 Factors and statistical data types",
    "text": "9.2 Factors and statistical data types\nThe types of variable will heavily influence what statistical analysis you can perform, e.g. you’ll need numeric values for a t-test. R is there to help by assigning datatypes to each field. We have different sorts of data that can be stored:\n\n\nCategorical - data that can be divided into groups or categories\n\nNominal - categorical data where the order isn’t important, e.g. gender, or colours\nOrdinal - categorical data that may have order or ranking, e.g. exam grades (A, B, C, D) or lickert scales (strongly agree, agree, disgaree, strongly disagree)\n\nNumeric - data that consists of numbers\n\nContinuous - numeric data that can take any value within a given range, e.g. height (178cm, 134.54cm)\nDiscrete - numeric data that can take only certain values within a range, e.g. number of children in a family (0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nBut here we are going to look at how R handles factors. Factors have two parts, levels and codes. levels are what you see when you view a table column, codes are an underlying order to the data. Factors allow you to store data that has a known set of values that you might want to display in an order other than alphabetical. For example, if we look at the month field ST003D02T using the levels(&lt;field&gt;) command:\n\nlevels(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1] \"January\"        \"February\"       \"March\"          \"April\"         \n [5] \"May\"            \"June\"           \"July\"           \"August\"        \n [9] \"September\"      \"October\"        \"November\"       \"December\"      \n[13] \"Valid Skip\"     \"Not Applicable\" \"Invalid\"        \"No Response\"   \n\n\nWe can see that the months of the year are there along with other possible levels. With this particular column there are levels for missing or wrong responses (“Valid Skip”, “Not Applicable” “Invalid”, “No Response”), though PISA rarely uses them. You are more likely to find that missing/wrong data items are coded as NA, as you can see below:\n\nPISA_2022 %&gt;% count(ST003D02T)\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   ST003D02T     n\n   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1 January   48760\n 2 February  43030\n 3 March     48671\n 4 April     47014\n 5 May       49235\n 6 June      48890\n 7 July      51262\n 8 August    51681\n 9 September 51755\n10 October   51703\n11 November  48179\n12 December  48156\n13 &lt;NA&gt;      25408\n\n\nCodes are the underlying numbers/order for each level, in this case 1 = January, 2 = February, etc. R stores factors as codes, then uses the levels to display the data. You can see the codes by using the as.numeric command on a factor:\n\nas.numeric(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1]  5  2  8  7  1  5  5 12  8  9 10  4  5  8  7  2  3  6  3  8 10  1 10  2  5\n[26]  6  8  1  3  2  5  7 12  4  1 10 10  3  3  9\n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 613704 entries ]\n\n\nHow can this be useful? Firstly it’s more efficient for R to store data this way, numbers (codes) are smaller and easier to sort/search than text (levels). But it also helps when we come to presenting data. A good example is how plots are made, they will use the codes to give an order to the display of columns, in the plot below, February (2) comes before August (8), even though there were more students born in August and A is before F in the alphabet:\n\ngrph_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n         group_by(ST003D02T) %&gt;% \n         summarise(n=n())\n\ngrph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n [1] September October   August    July      May       June      January  \n [8] March     November  December  April     February  &lt;NA&gt;     \nattr(,\"label\")\n[1] Student (Standardized) Birth - Month\n16 Levels: January February March April May June July August ... No Response\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nTo re-order the columns to match the number of students in each month, we can either try to do this manually, which is rather cumbersome:\n\nmy_levels &lt;- c(\"September\", \"October\", \"August\", \"July\", \"May\", \"June\", \n               \"January\", \"March\", \"November\", \"December\", \"April\", \"February\",\n               \"Valid Skip\", \"Not Applicable\", \"Invalid\", \"No Response\")\n\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nOr we can get R to do this for us:\n\n# get the levels in order and pull/create a vector of them\nmy_levels &lt;- grph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n# reassign the re-ordered levels to the dataframe column\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nTo learn a lot more about factors, see Hadley’s chapter"

This package is pretty much the industry standard for making graphs for publication. ggplot2 is built on the grammar of graphics where you build graphs by specifying underlying attributes and layering geometric objects on top of each other. In the diagram below you can see how a graph is built from geometric objects (the things that are plotted such as points and bars) a scale, and plot annotations (e.g. a key, title etc). You can then apply faceting to the graph to automatically split one graph into multiple plots, allowing you to easily compare different groupings. Publications, such as the Financial Times, make daily use of ggplot2.\n\n\n\nAdapted from A Layered Grammar of Graphics, Wickham, 2010"

Once these have been declared in the ggplot(...) function, their values are passed down to any subsequent geom_, in this case geom_point will use the data and x and y values that have been specified in ggplot(...)\n\n# create a new dataframe of maths and reading scores by country and OECD status\n1country_plot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n3  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH),\n            mean_read = mean(PV1READ),   \n            sz = n())\n\n# using this new dataframe, show the relationship between maths and reading score\n# using geom_points\n4ggplot(data=country_plot_data,\n5       aes(x=mean_maths, y=mean_read)) +\n6  geom_point(aes(size=sz, colour=OECD), alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n1\n\npipe the large data.frame PISA_2022 to apply a number of functions.\n\n2\n\ngroups by OECD (a Yes or No indicating membership) and CNT (the name of the country).\n\n3\n\ncalculate the mean mathematics and reading score, and create new variables (mean_maths, and mean_read) for their values.

These values will be passed to any subsequent geom_\n\n6\n\nWe make a number of tweaks to the points: first setting the aesthetics - the size of the points is linked to the sz variable we created, the number of responses per country, and the colour is linked to OECD membership.

To compare different groups we need the bars to not be stacked, we want them next to each other, or in ggplot language, we want the bars to dodge each other, to do this we add the position=position_dodge() command to line 3 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.1 Raising the bars yourself\nggplot can do a lot of the hard work when putting together bar charts, e.g. counting the number of students in each group, but there might also be times when you want to use pipes to calculate summary values that you then want plot. That is, you want to specify the heights of the bars yourself. To do this we will specify the y axis in the aes and use stat=\"indentity\" to tell ggplot that’s what we’re doing.

Better would be for us to have numbers listed at the top of each bar by adding a geom_text element:\n\nplot_cars &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(ST251Q01JA))\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST251Q01JA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) + \n1  geom_text(stat='count',\n2            aes(label=after_stat(count)),\n3            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n4            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n1\n\nline 6 starts the geom_text command, telling the geom to use the count statistic from ggplot, this means it will be able to fetch the number of rows in each grouping.\n\n2\n\nas we want the label to change for each bar element, we put label=after_stat(count) inside aes. The x location of the labels is inherited from line 4 and the y location will be calculated from the height of each bar\n\n3\n\nwe want the labels to align to the bars, so we tell the geom_text to also position_dodge, passing a width=0.9 to the dodge function, so the labels line up above the columns,\n\n4\n\nfinally, on line 9, we vertically adjust the labels vjust, so they sit on top of the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than adding the count, you might want to add the percentage that each bar represents, we can do this by changing the value given to label on line 5, below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST251Q01JA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +\n  geom_text(stat='count', \n            aes(label=100*(after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count))) %&gt;% round(3), \n            group = OECD), \n            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when we make graphs we often want to label the dataset, for example if we were to plot all the countries and their PV1MATH and PV1READ scores, we would get:\n\nplot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(m_read  = mean(PV1READ, na.rm=\"TRUE\"),\n            m_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=\"TRUE\"))\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\nThis looks great, but we don’t actually know which countries are which. To get this data we need to add text to the graph, using geom_text.\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label=CNT), \n            colour=\"black\", \n            check_overlap = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nHere we have used colour=\"black\" outside the aes to define the colour for all the labels, and check_overlap = TRUE which removes any labels that are on top of each other.

    "text": "This short course aims to take you through the process of writing your first programs in the R statistical programming language to analyse national and international educational datasets. To do this we will be using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the tidyverse code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.\nThe R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular1 in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.\n# This example shows how R can pull data directly from the internet\n# tidy it and start making graphs.

These are text files that will tell the computer how to go through the process of loading, cleaning, analysing and presenting data. The sequential and modular nature of these files makes it very easy to develop and test each stage separately, reuse code in the future, and share with others.\nThis booklet is written with the following sections to support you:\n# Code examples and questions appear like this\na &lt;- 1 + 3\nCourier font indicates keyboard presses, column names, column values and function names.\n&lt;folder&gt; Courier font within brackets describe values that can be passed to functions and that you need to define yourself.

    "section": "\n3.4 Datatypes",
    "text": "3.4 Datatypes\nWe have already met two different datatypes, the character datatype for words and letters (e.g. \"Peter\") and the numeric datatype for numbers (e.g. 12). Datatypes tell R how to handle data in certain circumstances. Sometimes data will be of the wrong datatype and you will need to convert between datatypes.\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\n# but it doesn't work!\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * days_in_week \n\nError in weeks * days_in_week: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nWhilst R will understand what to do when we multiply numbers with numbers, it gets very confused and raises an error when we try to perform an arithmetic operation using words and numbers.\nTo perform the calculation we will need to convert the days_in_week from a string to a number, using the as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;) command:\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * as.numeric(days_in_week)\n\nThere is a logical datatype for boolean values of TRUE and FALSE. This will become a lot more useful later.\n\nlegs_snake &lt;- FALSE # you can specify logical values directly\ndogs_legs &lt;- 4\nlegs_dog &lt;- dogs_legs &gt; 0 # or as part of a calculation\n\n# Do dog's have legs?\nprint(legs_dog)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThere are actually three datatypes for numbers in R, numeric for most of your work, the rarer integer specifically for whole numbers and the even rarer complex for complex numbers. When you are looking at categorical data, factors are used on top of the underlying datatype to store the different values, for example you might have a field of character to store countries, factors would then list the different countries stored in this character field.\nTo change from one datatype to another we use the as.____ command: as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;), as.logical(&lt;data&gt;), as.character(&lt;numeric&gt;).\n\n3.4.1 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix them so it outputs: “July is month 7”?\n\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)\nPrint(\"is\")\nprint(month)\nprint(\"order\")\n\n\nanswermonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)    \nprint(\"is\")     #1 print needs a lowercase p\nprint(\"month\")  #2 month is a character not an object, use speech marks\nprint(order)    #3 order is an object, not a character, so drop the speech marks\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\na &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- \"8\"\nc &lt; - 3\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\nanswera &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- 8 #1 b is numeric so drop the speech marks\nc &lt;- 3 #2 the arrow needs to be together, remove the space\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\npass mark &lt;- 50 \nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt; pass_mark)\n\n\nanswerpass_mark &lt;- 50 #1 the variable name can't have any spaces\nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt;= pass_mark) # this needs to be &gt;= as they had a passing grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out the datatype of an object you can use the structure str command to give you more information about the object. In this instance chr means that month is of character datatype and num means it is of the numeric datatype.\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\nstr(month)\n\n chr \"July\"\n\nmonth &lt;- 7\nstr(month)\n\n num 7"

    "section": "1.1 The PISA assessments",
    "text": "1.1 The PISA assessments\nThe first International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) comparing the learning outcomes of school students between countries was attempted in the 1960s. However, ILSAs only became established and regular in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has tested 15-year-old students in a range of “literacies” or “competencies” every three years since 2000. There is a rotating focus on reading, mathematics and science, with PISA 2021 focusing on mathematics but delayed by the global pandemic until 2022 and the results only published in December 2023. Until then, PISA 2018, with a focus on reading, was the most recently available cycle and PISA 2015 remains the most recent cycle focusing on science.\nIn addition to reading, mathematics and science, PISA has tested students on a range of “novel” competencies including problem-solving, global competence, financial literacy, and creative thinking. In addition to these tests, PISA also administers questionnaires to students, teachers and parents to identify “factors” which explain test score differences within and between countries.\nSince 2000, more than 90 “countries and economies” and around 3,000,000 students have participated in PISA. The growth in the number of countries participating in each cycle of PISA is reflected in the growth in the number of students taking the PISA tests and responding to the PISA questionnaires, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Number of students participating in PISA by year\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber completing assessment\n\n\n\n\n2000\n265,000\n\n\n2003\n275,000\n\n\n2006\n400,000\n\n\n2009\n470,000\n\n\n2012\n510,000\n\n\n2015\n540,000\n\n\n2018\n600,000\n\n\n2022\n690,000\n\n\n\nThere is a degree of inherent error in all educational and psychological assessments - and indeed in all social or physical measurement. ILSAs such as PISA may be more prone to error because their comparisons across large and diverse populations make them particularly complex. However, it is particularly important to minimise the error in ILSAs because they influence education policy and practice across a large number of education systems, impacting a vast population of students beyond those sampled for the assessments.\nAccording to the OECD (2019), three sources of error are worth considering. First, sampling error, uncertainty in the degree to which results from the sample generalise to the wider population - in 2018, the OECD average sampling error was 0.4 of a PISA point score (the value was not reported for 2022). Second, measurement error, uncertainty in the extent to which test items measure proficiency. In 2018, the measurement error was around 0.8 of a point in mathematics and science and 0.5 of a score point in reading (the measurement error was not reported for 2022). Third, the link error is the uncertainty in comparison between scores in different years. For comparisons of science scores between 2018 and 2015, the link error is 1.5 points. For 2018-2022, the link errors are reading (1.47), mathematics (2.24) and science (1.61) (OECD 2022, 293)\nPISA uses a probabilistic, stratified clustered survey design (Jerrim et al. 2017). However, sampling issues including sample representativeness, non-response rates and population coverage have been identified (Zieger et al. 2022; Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2016; Gillis, Polesel, and Wu 2016; Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl 2007). Furthermore, Anders et al. (2021) and Jerrim (2021) have shown that assumptions for imputing values (imputing means estimating any missing values based on existing data - for example by adding a mean or mode score for a missing test) for non-participating students used to construct the sample may have significant impacts on achievement scores.\nSince PISA 2015, the majority of participating countries have switched from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment (Jerrim 2016). A randomised controlled trial conducted by the OECD prior to the switch indicated a difference in score between the two modes of delivery. The OECD introduced an adjustment to compensate for this difference, but it is not entirely removed by the adjustment Jerrim et al. (2018), with implications for any time series comparisons between PISA cycles. Nonetheless, Jerrim (2016) notes that “in terms of cross-country rankings, there remains a high degree of consistency… the vast majority of countries are simply ‘shifted’ by a uniform amount” (pp. 508-509).\nIn summary, comparisons within and between countries and comparisons over time using ILSAs need careful interpretations that bear in mind the specific design of each ILSA. In practice, this means considering a range of potential explanations for score differences. Does a difference in science ranking between two countries simply reflect sampling error? Does the same parental occupation or home possessions amount to the same economic, social and cultural status in different countries (e.g. the social status of a parent as a teacher or the economic status of the number of cars a family owns)? Does a difference in mathematical self-efficacy (i.e. student self-confidence in mathematics) between the USA and Japan reflect sociocultural differences in self-enhancement and modesty, respectively? How do score differences between boys and girls indicate gender inequalities in education that reflect wider society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor useful critique and discussion of the construction of the measure of socio-economic status in PISA data see: Avvisati’s (2020) paper."

    "text": "1.2 Using the command line for descriptive statistics\nFor further reading on descriptive statistics see chapter 5 of Navaro’s Learning Statistics with R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are going to focus on the following variables in the PISA_2022 data frame:\n\nCNT the country of the student.\nHOMEPOS is a self-reported measure of a student’s wealth, linked to the number of possessions students report having in their home (e.g. books, computers, cars, phones etc.). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.447, minimum of -10.07 and a maximum of 15.24.\nESCS is the index of economic, social and cultural status. It might be thought of as a measure of economic and social status (with some cultural capital measures included). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.310, minimum of -6.84 and a maximum of 7.38. It is constructed from three items: highest parental occupation (HISEI), highest level of parental education (PARED), and home possessions (HOMEPOS), including books in the home\nPV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ are the plausible value scores for achievement tests in mathematics, science and reading, respectively. The full achievement tests are long, so each student only completes a subset of items (which still takes 2 hours). Statistical models are then used to calculate an overall score, based on the students’ answers to the subset of questions, as if students had answered all the questions. Ten different approaches (ten different statistical models, that take different approaches to estimating the overalls score are used) to calculating a representative scores, plausible values are used, leading to ten different plausible values. In this course, will just use the first plausible value (PV1). This differs from the PISA recommendation for using the scores, but simplifies things for teaching. For more on plausible values see: What are plausible values?\nST004D01T is the gender variable and and can take the values: Male, Female or NA.\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to find information about a data frame is to use the console. You can type commands to find out about a data frame directly into the console. To preform an action on a particular column (also called a vector), we use the $ symbol. For example, to refer to country data (which is in the vector CNT) we would use PISA_2022$CNT\nIn the command line, if you want to find the mean of all the repsonses to the HOMEPOS (Home Possessions, a proxy for wealth) item you can type the following:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$HOMEPOS)\n\nNotice that you get this response: [1] NA. An NA in the data frame can occur for a number of reasons, for example it may indicate a response is missing or incomplete, hence the mean can’t be calculated. To tell R to ignore NAs, we add na.rm = TRUE to a function:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nYou can use the command line with a number of functions to find useful information about a data frame. R has a number of standard functions that might be useful for descriptive statistics. To find out details about data frames, you can use:\n\nnrow() finds the number of rows (e.g. nrow(PISA_2022))\nncol() finds the number of columns (e.g. ncol(PISA_2022))\nnames() finds the names of all the columns (e.g. names(PISA_2022))\n\nIf you are working on individual columns, e.g. max(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE), you can use:\n\nmean() - finds the arithmetic mean\nmedian() - finds the median value\nmin() - finds the minimum value\nmax() - finds the maximum value\nsd() - finds the standard deviation\nrange() - finds the range of values\nlength()- finds the number of items\nunique() - finds the unique items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMaybe surprisingly, there is no function to calculate the mode in the tidyverse package. However, you can get one by loading the modeest package and using the most frequent value (mfv) function.\n\n# Install the modeest package to calculate a mode\n\nlibrary(modeest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# The mode can be found with the most frequent value (mfv) function\n# We can look at about number of books in the home (ST255Q01JA)\n# Then use mfv to find the mode value (note the na.rm=TRUE to avoid NAs)\n\nmfv(PISA_2022$ST255Q01JA, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 26-100 books\n11 Levels: There are no books. 1-10 books 11-25 books ...

This command outputs the minimum, median, mean, maximum (and 1st and 3rd quartile values, i.e. the values at 25% and 75% of the range).

    "text": "4.4 Categorising data\nA useful analytical choice is to categorise some a numerical variable into ordinal classes. For example, rather than treating HOMEPOS as a continuous scale, you might want to split into high and low wealth groups (for example, those above and below the mean value).\nTo do this, first calculate the mean mean(HOMEPOS). Then we add a new vector, which we will call wealthclass using the mutate function. We set the value of wealthclass using ifelse.

Typically, this is set to 0.05, or 5%, but in other cases it might be as high as 0.1 or as low as 0.01 or 0.001 depending on the circumstances. Therefore, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis and if it less than 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nWhen considering the number of tails, we then need to consider the p-value here also. If we set the overall probability to be 0.05 for the threshold that we reject the null hypothesis, then for a one-tailed test we compare our result with 0.05. However, with a two-tailed test, since we are looking at a two-tailed test, then the probability of each of the tails is 0.025 and therefore we compare our value with 0.025 instead.\nConventionally, we use 0.05 (1 in 20) as the cut off for statistical significance (a convention that has been much critiqued e.g. (Jacob Cohen 1994; Baker 2016))."

    "text": "2.4 One Sample t-tests\nOne sample t-tests are used to compare the mean of a sample of a data set with a value. This value is usually a known population mean or a theoretical population mean depending on the context of the test.\nFor a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean ≠ population mean.\n\nFor a one-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows (depending on the direction of the test)\nEither,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &gt; population mean.\n\nOr,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &lt; population mean.\n\nExample: Are Females’ Reading Scores in the UK the Same or Different on Average to the UK Average?\nLet’s look at an example of where we might want to consider a sample, in this case females’ reading scores in the UK, with a presumed population mean, the average reading score in the UK. This is a presumed mean, since we don’t know the true population mean here, but we do know the average reading score from the PISA data, which is 494 (taken from PISA 2022).\nFollowing the steps for performing a hypothesis test, we will start by selecting the appropriate test. Since we are comparing the mean of one sample with a population mean, then we need to use a one sample t-test.\nFirst, you will need to load the PISA data:\n\n# Load PISA Data\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[add the link to your data file]\")\n\nTo ensure we can use this test we need to make sure the conditions are met. Since PISA tests are constructed in a way which means they are normally distributed, then it is likely our sample is also normally distributed. However, it is good practice to check the distribution using a histogram (or qqplot) at the very least, and where appropriate, a normality test. Due to the large sample size normality testing isn’t usually required, so we will just consider a histogram (or qqplot) here.\n\n# Define PISA UK Girls Dataset\nPISA_2022_Read_Girls &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1READ, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" & ST004D01T == \"Female\")\n\n# Plot histogram\n4ggplot(data = PISA_2022_Read_Girls,\n5       aes(x = PV1READ)) +\n6  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - select the variables of interest\n\n3\n\nline 3 - filter for the UK and for girls\n\n4\n\nline 4 - pass the data to ggplot\n\n5\n\nline 5 - put reading scores (PV1READ) on the x-axis\n\n6\n\nline 6 - use geom_histogram to create a histogram. We can define that the reading data is divided into bins of width 5 points (binwidth = 5) and set the colour of the bars (fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the histogram that the sample is approximately normally distributed (as it follows a bell shaped curve).\nNext, we state the null and alternative hypotheses. Since we are determining whether the average reading score is the same or different, we are using a two-tailed test. This gives us the following hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK = mean reading score in UK\nAlternative hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK ≠ mean reading score in UK\n\nHaving set up the hypotheses, we now need to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis being true. To do this, we use R’s t.test function and compare the scores for females in reading in the UK with the OECD average score for reading, which is defined as 476 (OECD website).\n\nOECD_ave_read_UK &lt;-(476)\nt.test(PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ, mu=OECD_ave_read_UK)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ\nt = 19.064, df = 6396, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 476\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 497.7143 502.6918\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  500.203 \n\n\nWe can see from the result that we get a p-value of &lt; 2.2e-16, which is very small. As this is lower than 0.025 (for a two-tailed test) we reject the null hypothesis.\nTherefore, we accept the null hypothesis that the average reading score for females in the UK is different to the overall average reading score in the UK. Looking at the average stated in the t-test, the average score is higher for girls, at 500.23."

They are unconnected in the sense that the samples taken are independent and are measurements of two unrelated groups.\nFor a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group ≠ sample mean of second group.\n\nFor a one-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows (depending on the direction of the test)\nEither,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group &gt; sample mean of second group.\n\nOr,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean of first group = sample mean of second group;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean of first group &lt; sample mean of second group.\n\nExample: Are Males’ and Females’ Maths Scores in the USA the Same or Different to One Another?\nLet’s say we want to discern if the average maths score differ for males and females in the USA. We want to test to see if there is a statistical difference between the means.\nFollowing the steps for performing a hypothesis test, we will start by selecting the appropriate test. Since we are comparing the means of two, unrelated samples (since they are the measurements of two different groups that are not connected) then we use an unpaired t-test.\nAgain, we need to check if the groups are approximately normally distributed so check the histogram of each group.\n\n# Create a US maths subsets\nUSMATH&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1MATH,ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United States\")\n\nUSMATHGIRLS &lt;- USMATH %&gt;%\n4  filter(ST004D01T == \"Female\")\n\nUSMATHBOYS &lt;- USMATH %&gt;%\n5  filter(ST004D01T == \"Male\")\n# Plot histogram\n# For girls\n6ggplot(data = USMATHGIRLS,\n7       aes(x = PV1MATH)) +\n8  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - select the variables of interest, country, maths scores, and gender\n\n3\n\nline 3 - filter for the US\n\n4\n\nline 4 - create a new data frame USMATHGIRLS of the data for girls\n\n5\n\nline 6 - create a new data frame USMATHBOYSS of the data for boys\n\n6\n\nline 7 - pass the data to ggplot\n\n7\n\nline 8 - put maths scores (PV1MATH) on the x-axis\n\n8\n\nline 9 - use geom_histogram to create a histogram. We can define that the reading data is divided into bins of width 5 points (binwidth = 5) and set the colour of the bars (fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# For boys\nggplot(data=USMATHBOYS,\n       aes(x=PV1MATH)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we can see both samples of males and females are approximately normally distributed.\nNext, we state the null and alternative hypotheses. Since we are determining whether the average maths scores are the same or different, we are using a two-tailed test. This gives us the following hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis: mean maths score for males in US = mean maths score for females in UK\nAlternative hypothesis: mean maths score for males in US ≠ mean maths score for females in UK.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of the null hypothesis being true. As before, we use R’s t.test function and compare the mean scores of males and females in the US.\n\n# Plot a two-sided, unpaired t-test\nt.test(PV1MATH ~ ST004D01T, data = USMATH, \n       paired = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PV1MATH by ST004D01T\nt = -3.9455, df = 4499.5, p-value = 8.086e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -16.59477  -5.57744\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            456.1248             467.2109 \n\n\nWe can see from the t-test result that the p-value returned is 8.086e-05. As this is lower than 0.025 (for a two-tailed test) we reject the null hypothesis.\nAs such, we accept the alternative hypothesis that the average scores for males and females in the US are statistically different, with the average score for males being higher than average score for females."

This difference is approximately 1.5 points.\n::: call-out tip\nIn R, there are often multiple ways of doing the same tests. Note with t.test there are two forms you can use, depending on the format of the data you want to test.\nFirst, in the example above, we had two data frames, for math scores, and science scores, so we can pass two data frames to t.test.\n\n# Carry out a two-sided, paired t-test\nt.test(UKMATH$PV1MATH, UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE, \n       paired = TRUE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  UKMATH$PV1MATH and UKSCIENCE$PV1SCIE\nt = -21.651, df = 12971, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.602602  -8.842174\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      -9.722388 \n\n\nAlternatively, our data might be in one data frame, with a variable indicating the two groups. For example, if we wanted to perform a test of UK science scores, we might create a single data frame in which the two groups are indicated by the column ST004D01T, gender. In that case, we can use the ~ operator to do a t.test on the PISAUK$PV1SCIE (i.e. the science scores) by (~) gender.\n\nUKSci&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT==\"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot a two-sided, unpaired t-test\nt.test(UKSci$PV1SCIE ~ ST004D01T, data = UKSci,\n       paired = FALSE, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  UKSci$PV1SCIE by ST004D01T\nt = -3.9298, df = 12964, p-value = 8.547e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10.553500  -3.529142\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            488.6962             495.7375 \n\n\n:::"

    "text": "3.1 Eta-squared\nNow knowing that there are significant differences between the two class groups, we can next determine how much variation in the test score is explained by class. To do this we calculate a variable called eta-squared.\nEta-squared gives the proportion of variance of means explained by each variable. The eta squared function is in the package lsr so we will install lsr, and then use the result of our anova (resaov) to calculate the eta squared variable using the function etaSquared. To report the value of eta as a percentage we need to multiply the output of eta by 100.\nEta squared tells us the proportion of the total variance in means that is explained by a variable (you can also think of it as an effect size). An eta squared value of 1 indicates all the variance of a sample is explain by some variable and 0 means the variable is not responsible for any of the observed variance. We can multiply the eta-squared score by 100 to get a value for the percentage of variance explained.\nThe percentage of variance of means explained is a useful figure. For example, it has been reported that schools only account for 14% of the variance in progress 8 scores, whilst family explains 43% (Wilkinson, Bryson, and Stokes (2018)).\n\nlibrary(lsr)\neta &lt;- as.data.frame(etaSquared(resaov))\neta &lt;- eta*100\neta\n\n      eta.sq eta.sq.part\nCNT 28.45522    28.45522\n\n\nThe important column here is the eta.sq column - it tells us that the country explains 28% of the variance in test scores.

    "text": "3.1 Other correlation-coefficients\nWhen looking for correlations in data that is non-parametric, i.e. not normally distributed you could use Spearman’s rank order correlation-coefficient (rho ρ) rather than Pearson’s r. cor.test(... method = \"...\") allows you to specify the method used for correlation, you can set this to Spearman’s rho by writing method = \"spearman\"\nData will need to contain continuous or ordinal variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data. The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables.\nWe want to look at the correlation between students self-efficacy in digital competencies (ICTEFFIC) and wealth (HOMEPOS) for students in the the UK. To make the data set manageable, let us examine girls whose mother or father is a software developer\n\n# create a data set for the UK, including the HOMEPOS and ICTEFFIC variables\nsub_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n              select(CNT, HOMEPOS, ICTEFFIC, ST004D01T, OCOD1, OCOD2) %&gt;%\n              filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n              filter(ST004D01T == \"Female\") %&gt;%\n              filter(OCOD1 == \"Software developers\" | OCOD2 == \"Software developers\")\n\nIt is unclear if ICTEFFIC, self-efficacy in digital competencies, is normalised. We can graph it with geom_density to find out:\n\nggplot(sub_data) + \n  geom_density(aes(x=ICTEFFIC))\n\n\n\n\nThe data has two peaks so doesn’t look very normal.\nWe can run the Shapiro-Wilk Test to check for the the normality of the data, any alpha value greater than 0.05 means we can assume that the data is normally distributed.\n\nshapiro.test(sub_data$ICTEFFIC)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  sub_data$ICTEFFIC\nW = 0.85272, p-value = 0.0001823\n\n\nIn this case the data isn’t normally distributed as p &lt; 0.05 and we need to use a non-parametric correlation test. We need to run Spearman rather than Pearson:\n\ncor.test(sub_data$HOMEPOS, sub_data$ICTEFFIC, method = \"spearman\")\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  sub_data$HOMEPOS and sub_data$ICTEFFIC\nS = 9301.1, p-value = 0.5459\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n       rho \n-0.1025489 \n\n\nThe result shows no significant correlation (p=0.5459) between wealth and IT self-efficacy for girls whose parents are software developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe central limit theorem means that when you have a sufficiently large sample you can presume that the data is normally distributed. As a rule of thumb “30 is the magic number”, and any samples you are studying with 30 or more data items can be treated as parametric, e.g. you would always use pearson when running correlation analysis on 30 or more items. This is a rough rule of thumb and you should always check the normality of your data before when checking and presenting any result any tests.\n!ADD REFERENCE!\n\n\nWhen dealing with non-parametric and small data sets you can also use Kendall’s Tau i.e. cor.test(... method = \"kendall\")"

In linear regression, with one dependent and one independent variable, we use the Method of Least Squares to find the line of best fit. The means finding a straight line that passes as close as possible to all the points. The distance between a point and this line is called a residual. The line of best fit is the line where the sum of the residuals squared is the smallest number possible.\n\n\nMethod of Least Squares\n\nThe line that is created can be described by the equation:\nOutput = Intercept + Coefficient * Input \nLet’s use linear regression to explore the relationship between the score in maths(PV1MATH) and the score in reading (PV1READ). To build this model we use the lm command:\nlm(&lt;dependent_var&gt; ~ &lt;independent_var&gt; , data=&lt;dataframe&gt;)\nThe first part defines the model we are going to explore, listing the dependent variable and separating it from the independent variable[s] with a tilde ~. You can specify multiple independent variables by adding more plusses, but for the example here we are only going to use one.

The null hypothesis is that one variable does not predict another, we can dismiss this. By looking at the Estimate we can also see by how much a PV1MATH grade would increase if the PV1READ increased by one: 0.7731. Additionally, we have R2 value of 0.691, this suggests that the model is very good at explaining the value of the dependent variable, 69.1% of the variance in the PV1MATH grade is explained by the PV1READ grade."

We are going to explore part of this paper by looking at another finding (figure 3a) that looked at girls’ achievement in the PISA_2015 science test compared to their maths and reading grades. Comparing this relative grade to boys in the same country, it showed that as gender equality of their country increased, the gap got bigger, i.e. the more gender equal a country, the worse the female relative performance in science.\n\nThe gender gap in intraindividual science scores (a) was larger in more gender-equal countries (rs = .42)"

    "text": "9.4 Standardising PISA results\nNext, we will try to wrangle the data into shape to recreate figure 3 from Stoet and Geary (2018). To do this we first need to standardise the grades for maths, science and reading so we can compare the results of students between countries without low performing or high performing countries skewing the results (see Chapter 7 for details on how to standardise data). Following the steps outlined on page 7:\n\n\nWe standardized the mathematics, science, and reading scores on a nation-by-nation basis. We call these new standardized scores zMath, zRead, and zScience.\nWe calculated for each student the standardized average score of the new z-scores and we call this zGeneral.\nThen, we calculated for each student their intra-individual strengths by subtracting zGeneral as follows: relativeSciencestrength = zScience - zGeneral, relativeMathstrength = zMath - zGeneral, relativeReadingstrength = zReading - zGeneral.\nFinally, using these new intra-individual (relative) scores, we calculated for each country the averages for boys and girls and subtracted those to calculate the gender gaps in relative academic strengths\n\n\nproduces the following code:\n\ncode# standardise the results for each student in line with pg7\n# https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/4753/6/symplectic-version.pdf\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# step 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015_GGGI %&gt;% \n  rename(gender = ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(zMaths   = scale(PV1MATH),\n         zScience = scale(PV1SCIE), \n         zReading = scale(PV1READ))\n\n# step 2\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(zGeneral = (zMaths + zScience + zReading) / 3)\n\n# step 3\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(rel_MATH = zMaths   - zGeneral,\n         rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n         rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral)\n\n# step 4 part 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT, gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(zMaths = mean(zMaths, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zScience = mean(zScience, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zReading = mean(zReading, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zGeneral = mean(zGeneral, na.rm=TRUE),\n            rel_MATH = zMaths - zGeneral,\n            rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n            rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral,\n            gggi = unique(Overall.Score))\n\n# step 4 part 2\npisa_gggi_diff &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, gender, gggi, rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = gender,\n              values_from = rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(difference =  Male - Female)\n\n\nFinally we will plot the results:\n\ngraph codelibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(pisa_gggi_diff,\n       aes(x=difference, y=gggi)) + \n  geom_point(colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label=CNT),\n            box.padding = 0.2,\n            max.overlaps = Inf,\n            colour=\"black\") +\n  xlab(paste0(\"relative difference in PV1SCIE scores (male-female)\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe graph is pretty good recreation of what the paper presented, with the general shape the same; differences in grades for each country might be explained by the original paper using 5 plausible values rather than just PV1SCIE, as we have used (Stoet and Geary 2020). Does the statistical model stand up to scrutiny? To find out we will use correlation. Stoet and Geary used Spearman’s rho, signified by the s in rs:\n\nThe most important and novel finding here is that the sex difference in intraindividual strength in science was higher and more favorable to boys in more gender-equal countries, rs = .42, 95% CI = [.19,.61], p &lt; .001, n = 62 (Fig. 3a)\n\nWe can run our version of this model using the following:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"spearman\")\nresult\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nS = 24384, p-value = 0.02763\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.2874342 \n\n\nOur model doesn’t show such a strong correlation. In fact, our model shows a “weak positive” relationship of just 0.287, albeit a significant one (p&lt;0.05).\nFor our version of this model it seems unnecessary to use Spearman’s rho, the number of countries we are comparing with valid data is 59 (pisa_gggi_diff %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% nrow()), which is greater than 30 and using the central limit theorem we should be able to use Pearson’s r. Additionally,shapiro.teston both difference andgggi give non-significant results, suggesting Pearson is the better test to use here:\n\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi) \n#&gt; p-value = 0.1226\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$difference)\n#&gt; p-value = 0.4078\n\nIf we run the model again using Pearson’s r, we get:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"pearson\")\nresult\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nt = 3.9972, df = 57, p-value = 0.0001863\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2406661 0.6465242\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4679109 \n\n\nA result much closer to the one published. The differences here might be the result of the different GGGI data set we used or a difference in the way we calculated difference, or something to do with the correlation model used. It would be good to know!\nWe can also explore this data using regression and a linear model looking at the relationship between difference in grades and the gggi value for each country:\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\nsummary(mdl)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.067343 -0.018964 -0.003605  0.023548  0.083991 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R2 is pretty decent too at 0.219 suggesting the finding that Stoet and Geary reported is a sound one."

    "section": "0.2 The Bayesian Approach to Statistics",
    "text": "0.2 The Bayesian Approach to Statistics\nThe Bayesian approach was developed by the English statistician and Presbyterian minister, Thomas Bayes. The Bayesian approach proposes a different model to expressing the outcome of statistical tests. Bayesian statistics report a probability expressing a degree of belief an event. Central to Bayesian statistics is the assumption that the degree of belief should be revised based on prior knowledge. This contrasts with frequentist statistics in which the null hypothesis is assumed, even though it is rare to genuinely believe in the null hypothesis - there are rarely no differences between groups (Murphy 1990). In Bayesian statistics, analysis is carried out in light of prior knowledge of probabilities of relevant events. In the case of the classes above, for example, information about prior achievement, and hence the likelihood of the two classes having the same mean score could be used in the calculation.\n\n“’The key ideas of Bayesian statistics: that probability is orderly opinion, and that inference from data is nothing other than the revision of such opinion in the light of relevant new information” (Edwards, Lindman, and Savage 1963, 194)\n\nBayes’ theorem can be stated mathematically as:\\(P(A\\vert B)=\\frac{P(B \\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}, \\text{ if } P(B) \\neq 0\\)\nA and B represent two events. \\(P(A)\\) represents the probability of A occurring and \\(P(A)\\) the probability of B happening. The formula assumes that \\(P(B)\\ne0\\), that is there is some probability the event B will happen.\n\\(P(A\\vert B)\\) is a conditional probability - that is, the probability that A will occur given that B has occurred.\n\\(P(B\\vert A)\\) is another conditional probability - this time, the probability that B will occur given that A has occurred.\nWe can see how the formula works in an example:\nImagine that the prevalence of students who have profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD) in state secondary schools in the UK is 1%. We might also know that the screening process for PMLD gives a false positive (i.e. incorrectly categorises a student with no learning difficulties with PMLD) 5% of the time.\nA student receives a diagnosis of PMLD - what is the probability that they have PMLD?\nWe can use the formula to find the probability that the student has PMLD, given that they have a positive test \\(P(HasPMLD\\vert PositiveTest)\\). But let us first consider the calculation intuitively.\n\\(P(HasPMLD\\vert PositiveTest)=\\frac{P(PositiveTest \\vert HasPMLD)P(HasPMLD)}{P(PositiveTest)}\\)\nIf we select 1000 people at random for PMLD testing, 10 will have PMLD. 990 students will not have PMLD. Of those 990 people, 5% will receive a positive screening. 5% of 990 is 49.5 people. So there are 10 (correct screenings) + 49.5 (false positives) = 59.5 people who test positive. The probability that someone has PMLD, given a positive test is \\(P(HasPMLD\\vert PositiveTest)\\) is \\(10/59.5=0.17\\) surprisingly low.\nWe can use the formula to get to the same result:\n\\(P(HasPMLD\\vert PositiveTest)=\\frac{P(PositiveTest \\vert HasPMLD)P(HasPMLD)}{P(PositiveTest)}\\)\n\\(P(PositiveTest \\vert HasPMLD)=1\\)\n\\(P(HasPMLD)=0.01\\)\n\\(P(PositiveTest)=(1*10/1000)+(0.05*990/1000)=0.0595\\)\n\\(P(HasPSMLD\\vert PositiveTest)=\\frac{(1)(0.01)}{(0.0595)}=0.17\\)\nThe example indicates the value of taking prior information into account when making inferences. Intuitively, it might be expected that, with the low rate of false positives (5%) a positive test would mean a high certainty of diagnosis. However, combined with knowledge of the prevalence of PMLD in the population, the probability of having PSMLD after a positive test is only around 1 in 5.\nThere are Bayesian versions of the inferential tests we have covered so far (t-tests, chi-squared, correlationa dn linear regression).\n\n0.2.1 The Bayesian t-test\nThe BayesFactor package can be used to perform a Bayesian version of the t-test. Let us perform the Bayesian test on the same class data we used above, for which we found a p-value of 0.0002.\n\nlibrary(BayesFactor)\n# Create two dummy class exam scores, as dataframes this time, as that is what the Bayesian t-test takes as an input\n\nClassA &lt;- data.frame(Scores = c(54,53,72,31,25,34,87,45,26,42,54,58,80))\nClassB &lt;- data.frame(Scores = c(82,94,88,76,82,60,88,90,75,77,96,61,74))\n\n# Label the classes A and B\nClassA &lt;- ClassA %&gt;%\n  mutate(Class=\"A\")\n\nClassB &lt;- ClassB %&gt;%\n  mutate(Class=\"B\")\n\n# Combine into one data frame\nTotaldata &lt;- rbind(ClassA, ClassB)\n\n# Perform the Bayesian test\nttestBF(data = Totaldata, formula = Scores ~ Class)\n\nBayes factor analysis\n--------------\n[1] Alt., r=0.707 : 194.1877 ±0%\n\nAgainst denominator:\n  Null, mu1-mu2 = 0 \n---\nBayes factor type: BFindepSample, JZS\n\n\nThe value of interest here is the Bayes factor, 194.1877, followed by the confidence interval ±0%.The Bayes factor can be thought of as a measure of the relative likelihood of a difference (in this case, a different in scores between the groups). Here the factor can be interpreted to mean: It is 194 times more likely that there is a difference between the two classes than there is no difference.\nBy comparison with a p-value, which acts only as a cut of for significance, the Bayes factor tells you the relative likelihood, a more useful piece of information.\n(Note that to calculate the Bayesian t-test, some assumptions have to be made. One is the assumption of a distribution of effect sizes, in this case a kind of distribution known as a Cauchy distribution is assumed, r=0.707 refers to a parameter of that distribution).\nNull, mu1-mu2 = 0 tells us that the null hypothesis is that the means (the mus) of the two groups are the same.\nAgainst denominator: Null, mu1-mu2 = 0 refers to the denominator (i.e the part below the line), in the Bayes theorem:\n\\(P(A\\vert B)=\\frac{P(B \\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}, \\text{ if } P(B) \\neq 0\\)\nIn this case \\(P(B)\\) refers to the probability that there is no difference between the classes.\n\n\n0.2.2 The Bayesian chi-square test\nThe BayesFactor package also contains a Bayesian version of the chi-square test. In the example below, there is some example data: the gender of 14 people is reported as well as whether each has a degree (expressed as 1 (has a degree), and 0 (has no degree)). The chi square test attempts to examine whether the distribution of degrees in the male and female groups is statistically signficant.\n\n# Create two a dataframe 1=has degree, 0=has no degree\nDegreeGender &lt;- data.frame(Gender = c(\"Male\",\"Male\",\"Female\",\"Male\",\"Female\",\"Female\",\n                                      \"Female\",\"Male\",\"Male\",\"Female\",\"Male\",\n                                      \"Female\",\"Female\",\"Male\"),\n                           Degree = c(1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0))\n\n\n# Create a contingency table\nconttab &lt;- xtabs(data = DegreeGender, ~ Degree + Gender)\nconttab\n\n      Gender\nDegree Female Male\n     0      5    3\n     1      2    4\n\n# Perform the Bayesian chi-square test\ncontingencyTableBF(conttab, sampleType = \"jointMulti\")\n\nBayes factor analysis\n--------------\n[1] Non-indep. (a=1) : 1.351891 ±0%\n\nAgainst denominator:\n  Null, independence, a = 1 \n---\nBayes factor type: BFcontingencyTable, joint multinomial\n\n# For comparison, perform the frequentist Chi square test\nchisq.test(conttab)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  conttab\nX-squared = 0.29167, df = 1, p-value = 0.5892\n\n\nThe outcome of the chi-square test, gives a Bayes factor of 1.351891. This value raises the question of how to interpret different values of Bayes factors. Kass and Raftery (1995) have suggested these labels for interpreting Bayes factors:\n\n\n\nBayes Factor\nStrength of evidence\n\n\n\n\n&lt;1\nThere is no difference.\n\n\n=1\nPresence or absence of a difference is equally likely\n\n\n1 to 3.2\nNot worth more than a bare mention\n\n\n3.2-10\nSubstantial\n\n\n10-100\nStrong\n\n\n&gt;100\nDecisive\n\n\n\nIn the case of the chi-square test above, the Bayes factor of 1.351891 falls into the category of ‘Not worth more than a bare mention’. This coheres with the frequentist chi-square result, p-value = 0.5892, which is interpreted as implying, given the null hypothesis, there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups.\n\n\n0.2.3 The Bayesian linear model\nWe covered linear models in an earlier sessions using the lm function - there is an alternative Bayesian version, in the brms package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that, when using brm the function can take some time to run!\n\n\n\n# Load the package to perform the Bayesian linear model\nlibrary(brms)\n# BRM is not the quickest Bayesian lm function, but it allows the calculation of an R2 equivalent which is really helpful\n\n# Create a dummy data frame with a random normally distributed variable, Var 1.

The Bayesian Regression Model function brm in the brms package extends the lm function by allowing us to provide a prior model of the independent variable. We do this by passing the mean and standard deviation of our independent variable to the set_prior function (we also specify the shape of the distribution, in our case, normal, and specify the name of our independent variable (PV1MATH)).\n\n# To predict 2022 PISA data, I am going to use prior information from the 2018 results\n#PISA2015studentbayes &lt;- read_parquet(\"/Users/k1765032/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-richardandrewbrock@gmail.com/.shortcut-targets-by-id/1c3CkaEBOICzepArDfjQUP34W2BYhFjM4/PISR/Data/PISA/2015/PISA2015studentbayes.parquet\")\n# PISA_2018 &lt;- read_parquet(glue(\"{datafolder}/PISA_2015_student_subset.parquet\"))\n\n# Find the prior distribution of UK mathematics scores we expect from previous years \n1math_summary &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(PV1MATH, CNT) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n4  summarise(mean = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n5math_summary\n\n6math_mean &lt;- math_summary %&gt;% pull(mean)\n7math_sd   &lt;- math_summary %&gt;% pull(sd)\n\nlibrary(brms)\n\n# Specify the prior distribution using set_prior from the `BMS` package\n\nprior2018 &lt;- c(set_prior(glue(\"normal({math_mean},{math_sd})\"), \n8                         class = \"b\", coef = \"PV1MATH\"))\n\n# Create the data frame of UK scores in 2018 to model\nUKPISA_2022 &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n9  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Use the Bayesian regression model function 'brm' to fir the model, specifying the prior\nmodbay &lt;- brm(data = UKPISA_2022, \n10              formula = PV1SCIE ~ PV1MATH, prior = prior2018)\n11summary(modbay)\n12bayes_R2(modbay)\n\n# Compare to the simple linear model\n13mod &lt;- lm(data = UKPISA_2022,\n          formula = PV1SCIE ~ PV1MATH)\n14summary(mod)\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 Pipe the PISA_2022 data into a new data frame math_summary\n\n2\n\nline 2 Select the maths and country items\n\n3\n\nline 3 Filter for the UK\n\n4\n\nline 4 Summarise the mean and standard deviation of the maths scores in the UK\n\n5\n\nline 5 Print the summary table\n\n6\n\nline 6 Use pull to assign the mean to a new variable math_mean\n\n7\n\nline 7 Use pull to assign the standard deviation to a new variable math_sd\n\n8\n\nline 10 Create the prior distribution. Here we use data from a previous PISA data set, the 2018 data. We first use glue to create the label for the distribution. The type of prior distribution is specified by some text, e.g. \"normal(0, 2)\" which sets the prior distribution to be a normal distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation 2. We use the glue function to join our calculated math_mean and math_sd with the word normal to create a string describing our prior The class is set to “b” the default, for fixed effects, and we specify the coef as the variable of interest PV1MATH.\n\n9\n\nline 12 We create data frame on which to run the model, 2022 maths data in the UK\n\n10\n\nline 14 We run the model on the 2022 data,

Note that this approach is not recommended :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Let the computer find out” is a poor strategy and usually reflects the fact that the researcher didnot bother to think clearly about the problem of interest and its scientific setting (Burnham and Anderson 2007, 147)\n\n\nNonetheless, once you have thought clearly about a range of models ranking the potential Bayesian models can provide insights. This can be done using the regressionBF function of the BayesFactor package. We call models &lt;- regressionBF(PV1SCIE ~ ., data = PISAUK) which asks for regression to predict science scores (PV1SCIE~) by all of the variables (.) in the data frame (data=PISAUK) Note that variables need to be converted to factor variables. The function returns a data.frame ranking the models, the one with the highest Bayes factor bf is a candidate for the best fit.\n\nlibrary(BayesFactor)\n\n# Create a UK subset                                                     \n1PISAUK &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, HOMEPOS, ESCS, CNT) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n  select(-CNT) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# Use regressionBF to create a dataframe of the models\n\n2models &lt;- regressionBF(PV1SCIE ~ ., data = PISAUK)\n\n# Select only the relevant part of the output\n\n3output &lt;- as.data.frame(models@bayesFactor)\n\n# Arrange the output\n\n4output &lt;- output %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(bf))\noutput\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 create a subset of UK data, select reading, science, maths, wealth (HOMEPOS), class (ESCS) and country variables, filter for the UK then drop the unneeded CNT variable, then drop NAs\n\n2\n\nThe regressionBF function creates a data frame with all the possible linear models using the specified variables\n\n3\n\nSelect only the Bayes factor, and covert to a data frame for sort\n\n4\n\nSort the output in descending order of Bayes Factor and print the output\n\n\n\n\n                                         bf        error\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + HOMEPOS        8062.475 1.573489e-06\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + HOMEPOS + ESCS 8061.225 1.088549e-04\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + ESCS           8059.345 1.571910e-06\nPV1MATH + PV1READ                  8036.480 3.141224e-06\nPV1MATH + HOMEPOS                  7537.090 3.468842e-06\nPV1MATH + HOMEPOS + ESCS           7534.309 1.336025e-06\nPV1MATH + ESCS                     7525.691 3.476922e-06\nPV1MATH                            7497.489 8.858089e-05\nPV1READ + HOMEPOS + ESCS           5254.970 6.513346e-06\nPV1READ + ESCS                     5242.466 3.000504e-06\n                                                       time         code\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + HOMEPOS        Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e9224ca1c36\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + HOMEPOS + ESCS Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e924188c6ef\nPV1MATH + PV1READ + ESCS           Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e9251023018\nPV1MATH + PV1READ                  Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e926cd5f401\nPV1MATH + HOMEPOS                  Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e925286a579\nPV1MATH + HOMEPOS + ESCS           Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e9266a3a134\nPV1MATH + ESCS                     Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024  3e925d9d543\nPV1MATH                            Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e922643a46f\nPV1READ + HOMEPOS + ESCS           Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024   3e92ac9191\nPV1READ + ESCS                     Fri Apr  5 10:47:36 2024 3e925329f79d\n [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 5 rows ]\n\n\nWe can compare the Bayes Factors of the models in a chart:\n\n1ggplot(output, aes(x = reorder(rownames(output), -bf),\n2                   y = bf, fill = rownames(output))) +\n3  geom_col() +\n4  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n5  labs(x=\"model\", y=\"Bayes Factor\")\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 Use ggplot passing the output data frame to create graph.
